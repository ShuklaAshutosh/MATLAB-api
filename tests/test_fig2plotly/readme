The tests found within test_fig2plotly are not PC compatible and rely on the folder structure remaining intact: 

plotly/tests/test_fig2plotly/AUX
plotly/tests/test_fig2plotly/BANK	
plotly/tests/test_fig2plotly/BANK/MPG
plotly/tests/test_fig2plotly/BANK/PD
plotly/tests/test_fig2plotly/BASE

Keep this in mind if you want to restructure this diretory/subdirectories.
